# Automaton
Fully open-source gestural MIDI instrument, built to interface with Reaper (DAW)

Built off of three sensors: 300mm linear potentiometer, Force-resistive sensor, mini two-axis joystick.
Files can easily be 3D printed, or fabricated in various other ways.
Due to the ergonomics involved, editable .3dm files are included for modifications or additions.
Capable of linking directly to free-DAW Reaper as a custom MIDI device.
